## Hello, I'm Nova

**👋 About Me:** *I use they/them pronouns (any are welcome). I’m currently an undergraduate university student and an aspiring software engineer. I take pride in my ability to quickly learn new skills and am always seeking better, more effective ways to grow and apply myself in the field of software development. While my primary focus is programming, I also have an intermediate background in digital art, including line art, pixel art, and oil painting.*

*I’m an energetic and optimistic person who continues moving forward regardless of circumstances, and I enjoy supporting others who may be struggling to do the same. In my downtime, I like watching movies, reading, and working on a wide range of creative projects, such as coding projects, game modding, cosplay prop creation, character art, and creative writing. I’ve explored many creative disciplines, which makes me highly versatile and adaptable when approaching new challenges.*

**🎓 Education:** 
*Graduated Springboro High School*
*Undergraduate at Wright State University, persuing bachelor's*

Future Projects(this semester):
- Participate in a game jam
*Overview: This semester I'm gonna commit to learning C#, and using the knowledge I gain to make a simple side scroller game jam game. My goal will be to make it within a short time frame, with my own pixel art, and mechanics.*
- Hackathon
**Overview: A college team coding competition where a bunch of students solve as many problems as possible in the span of a few hours. The team with the best, style and most problems solves wins.
